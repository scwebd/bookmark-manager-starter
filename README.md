# JavaScript Bookmark Manager

Starter code for the DU Coding Boot Camp JavaScript Review Session. We'll build out the JavaScript for a simple Bookmark Manager App using localStorage and vanilla JavaScript.

If we have time during the session, we'll also code out the same functionality using jQuery to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences in syntax between the two.
